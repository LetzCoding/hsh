#HSH help - intro#
	HSH is both a computer language and a shell. It has these commands:
	1. hsh        ---- see "help hsh"
	2. exit       ---- see "help exit"
	3. help       ---- help commandname
	4. //         ---- It has no use
    5. echo       ---- echo string
	You can use them to make some programmes. Use "hsh programname" to execute it.
